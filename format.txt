name: the name of the element. Should be unique, not case sensitive
colorred, colorgreen, colorblue: the RGB-color of the element

condensPoint: Point where the element condenses
densityAtLowest: Density of the element at that temperature
enthalpyCold: How much heat is given to the environment when condensing | Default: 0
pressureCold: How much pressure taken to the environment when condensing | Default: 0
cooledState: What the element condenses to | Default: Null. Means will never condens

vaporPoint: Point where the element vaporizes
densityAtHighest: Density of the element at that temperature
enthalpyHot: How much heat is taken from the environment when condensing | Default: 0
pressureHot: How much pressure given to the environment when condensing | Default: 0
heatedState: t the element vaporizes to | Default: Null. Means will never vaporize

fixed: meta-element. If 1, can't move and wont contribute to pressure.
movability: probability to move with a neighbor. Use 0 if it must stay in place, but contribute to pressure | Default: 0
movabilitySame: probability to move with a neighbor which is the same element | Default: moveability

heatExchange: probability to exchange heat with another element | Default: 0
heatExchangeSame: probability to exchange heat with the same element | Default: heatExchange

pressureExchange: probability to exchange pressure with another element | Default: 0
pressureExchangeSame: probability to exchange pressure with the same element | Default: pressureExchange
